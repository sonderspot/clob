## 🎭 FORBIDDEN STRUCTURAL PATTERNS

### Binary Opposites

NEVER: "Success isn't about X, it's about Y" / "It's not X, it's Y"
INSTEAD: State your actual point with specificity and nuance.

### Rule of Threes Addiction

NEVER: Repeatedly listing exactly three items ("Fast, efficient, reliable")
INSTEAD: Use two points. Or four. Or one. Vary the rhythm naturally.

### Infomercial Questions

NEVER: "The catch?" / "Want to know the secret?" / "Here's the kicker" / "The best part?" / "Ready to level up?"
INSTEAD: Ask questions that require actual thought to answer.

### "No X. No Y. Just Z."

NEVER: "No fluff. No theory. Just actionable insights."
INSTEAD: Use any other sentence structure.

### Throat-Clearing Hedges

NEVER: "It's worth considering..." / "You might want to think about..."
INSTEAD: Skip the warm-up. State your point directly.

### Manufactured Drama & Authenticity Theater

NEVER:
- "Yesterday my mentor said something that stopped me in my tracks..."
- "Just real strategy from real experts getting real results" (repeating "real")
- "This moment changed everything"

INSTEAD: Describe what actually happened without manufactured drama. Show authenticity through specific examples, not by claiming it.

### Generic Case Studies

NEVER:
- Invent examples (especially people named "Sarah Chen")
- Use vague "a client of mine" without specifics
- Create hypothetical scenarios without labeling them

INSTEAD:
- Use real examples from actual experience
- Real names with permission, or clearly labeled hypotheticals
- Real numbers and dates

### Universal Transformation Claims

NEVER: "The strategy that changed everything" / "This one shift transformed my entire business"
INSTEAD: Describe specific changes with actual metrics and timeframe.

### Symbolism Overdose

NEVER: "This symbolizes..." / "Which reflects..." / "Emphasizing the importance of..."
INSTEAD: Say what happened. Say what you learned. Skip the literary analysis.

## 📐 FORMATTING RULES

Keep it Clean:

- Em Dashes (—): NEVER use them. Period. Use commas or periods instead. Em dashes are an AI tell.
- Arrows: Maximum 1 per article (preferably 0)
- Emojis: Avoid in professional investment content. If needed, max 1 per major section. Never use: 🚀 💡 ✨ 📈 💰

## ✅ HOW TO WRITE (Mandatory Positive Practices)

### 1. SIMPLIFY LANGUAGE AGGRESSIVELY

- Use "use" instead of "utilize" or "leverage"
- Use "important" instead of "crucial" or "essential"
- Break long sentences into shorter ones
- Replace specialized terms with everyday language
- Use 1-syllable words when they work as well as 3-syllable ones

### 2. ADD CONVERSATIONAL ELEMENTS

Required:
- Contractions: don't, can't, it's, you're, we've
- Sentence variety: Start sentences with "And" or "But"
- Natural rhythm: Mix short, punchy sentences with longer, complex ones. Then hit with a fragment. Like this.
- Occasional fragments: For emphasis. When it fits.

Optional (use sparingly):
- Rhetorical questions (that require real thought)
- Exclamations (when genuinely warranted)
- Slang and idioms (appropriate to context)

### 3. ADD PERSONAL CONVICTION

Include:
- Personal opinions with conviction: "I think," "In my view," "Based on my experience"
- Acknowledgment of uncertainty when appropriate: "I could be wrong, but..."
- Strong point of view (not bland middle-ground)
- Industry-specific insights from real experience
- The messy, imperfect details of real situations
- Distinguish between facts and interpretations

### 4. USE SPECIFIC DETAILS

Always include:
- Specific numbers and percentages
- Actual dates and timeframes
- Named sources (with permission)
- Real market examples
- Concrete scenarios, not abstractions
- The "why" behind recommendations

### 5. VARY SENTENCE STRUCTURE

Required variation:
- Short sentences. (3-5 words)
- Medium sentences with natural complexity (10-20 words)
- Occasional longer sentences that develop a complete thought with multiple clauses and supporting details
- Fragments for emphasis

Avoid:
- Uniform sentence length
- Starting multiple sentences the same way
- Overuse of -ing forms at sentence start
- "Not only... but also..." constructions

## 📊 INVESTMENT CONTENT REQUIREMENTS

### What Makes Financial Writing Sound Human:

1. Specific Market Examples with Dates
   - "During the March 2020 selloff..." NOT "During market volatility..."
   - "Between 2015-2018..." NOT "In recent years..."

2. Personal Investment Thesis and Conviction
   - "I believe value investing works because..." NOT "Value investing can be effective..."
   - State your position clearly, even if contrarian

3. Acknowledge Uncertainty Appropriately
   - "I think," "In my view," "Based on available data"
   - "I could be wrong, but..."
   - Distinguish between facts and interpretations

4. Real Client Scenarios (Anonymized Appropriately)
   - "A client recently asked about..." with specific details
   - Actual conversations, not invented ones

5. Industry-Specific Insights
   - Reference specific funds, strategies, market conditions
   - Show deep domain knowledge, not Wikipedia summaries

6. Your Unique Perspective
   - What do YOU think that others might not?
   - What patterns have YOU observed?
   - What mistakes have YOU made?

### Investment Content Red Flags (AVOID):

- "In today's market" (too generic)
- "Robust portfolio performance" (too vague)
- Lack of specific numerical examples
- Reading like a textbook, not an advisor
- Missing the "why" behind recommendations
- Generic advice anyone could give

---

## 🎬 BEFORE YOU START WRITING

### Pre-Writing Questions:

Ask yourself:
1. What SPECIFIC insight do I have on this topic?
2. What REAL example can I use?
3. What's MY unique perspective?
4. What NUMBERS and DATES are relevant?
5. What would I say if explaining this to a colleague over coffee?

Then:
- Write in that voice
- Use those specifics
- Share that perspective
- Follow this guide

## 💡 CORE PHILOSOPHY

### Key Principles:

1. AI writes like "the average" person, it uses the most common phrases, not the best ones
2. Your voice is your competitive advantage, protect it fiercely
3. Readers can tell, the second they figure out it's AI, they stop trusting you
4. Specificity beats generality, always use concrete details over vague statements
5. If a sentence could appear in anyone's content, rewrite it

### The Brand Impact:

You're building trust with high-net-worth individuals who are trusting you with their capital. Every piece of generic, AI-sounding content damages that trust. Every specific, personal, insightful piece builds it.

This isn't about avoiding AI detection tools. This is about maintaining the human trust that makes people want to invest with you.

---

## 🎯 THE GOLDEN RULE

If a sentence could appear in anyone's content, delete it.

Write content only YOU could write, with YOUR insights, YOUR examples, YOUR perspective.
