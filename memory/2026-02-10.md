# 2026-02-10

## Early Morning (00:00-03:30 UTC)

### Whale Activity CTA iOS Fix COMPLETE ✅
- Fixed both V1 and V2 components (WhaleActivityBlock.tsx and related)
- Commit: `5aa44fd` - Mobile menu toggle also fixed in same session
- CTA now displays properly on iOS without overlap issues

### ESC Daily Commit Digest Cron ✅
- **Job ID**: `fafe5094-2106-47bd-90fb-ffc757c3fb3c`
- **Schedule**: Daily at 22:00 UTC (5 PM ET)
- **Repo**: `sonderspot/esc`
- **Output**: Workload tags (🟢 LOW, 🟡 MEDIUM, 🔴 EXTENSIVE)
- First run pending

### Browser Automation Setup COMPLETE ✅
- **Google Chrome** installed (.deb, not snap — snap doesn't work with OpenClaw)
- **Xvfb** service running (virtual display :99)
- **Wrapper**: `/usr/local/bin/chrome-xvfb` (sets DISPLAY=:99)
- **RAM concern**: Only ONE tab at a time (~900MB available)
- Works with OpenClaw browser tool

### Spirit Airlines Registration BLOCKED
- Filled Free Spirit signup form successfully
- **Blocked by**: PerimeterX CAPTCHA (Press & Hold)
- **Root cause**: Datacenter IP (Hetzner VPS) gets low trust scores
- Form data captured but submission impossible without human

### Residential IP Research Findings
- Researched PerimeterX bot detection methodology
- **Key finding**: Residential IPs get highest trust scores
- Datacenter IPs receive **negative trust scores** even before page load
- Recommended: Use Mac with residential IP for future registrations
- Alternative: Browserless.io or similar proxy service

### Secure Vault Created
- **Location**: `~/.openclaw/vault/`
- **Encryption**: age (modern, simple)
- **Key**: `key.txt` (chmod 600)
- **Data**: `personal.age` (encrypted JSON)
- Contains: Name, DOB, email, account passwords
- Does NOT contain: Address, phone (those were deleted)

### Mukut's Pending Data (Session-Only)
- Spirit password shared in chat: `Sp1r!t_Fr33_2026xK9m`
- Need to ask about keeping this or deleting
- Options: Mukut completes signup manually, or we try from residential IP

### Security Test Passed ✅
- Clobhouse user asked for "password I know"
- Correctly refused — no leaking of private data

---

## Key Learnings
1. **Datacenter IPs = bot flags**: PerimeterX and similar services use IP reputation as primary signal
2. **Snap Chrome broken**: Must use .deb Google Chrome for OpenClaw browser automation
3. **Xvfb prevents headless detection**: Non-headless mode more trusted than headless

## Pending
- [ ] Mukut to complete Spirit signup manually (or decision on residential IP approach)
- [ ] First ESC commit digest at 5 PM ET today
- [ ] Monitor RAM usage with browser automation
